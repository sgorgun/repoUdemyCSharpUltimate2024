"params" keyword - Does Stack contain any of the given words?
In the StackExtensions class, implement an extension method for Stack<string> called DoesContainAny, which takes a params array of strings as input. This method should return true if this stack contains any of the given words and false otherwise.



For example:

For Stack with items "fox", "cat", and "wolf" and input containing words "cow" and "cat", the result shall be true





For Stack with items "fox", "cat", and "wolf" and input containing words "deer", "mouse", and "dog", the result shall be false
