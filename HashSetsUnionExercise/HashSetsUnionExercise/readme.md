HashSet - CreateUnion method
Implement the CreateUnion method, which takes two HashSets and builds a new HashSet containing all items from both input HashSets.

For example:

for set1 containing numbers {1,2,3,4,5} and set2 containing numbers {4,5,6}, the result shall be {1,2,3,4,5,6}

for set1 containing strings {"a", "b"} and set2 containing strings {"c", "d"}, the result shall be {"a", "b", "c", "d"}

This method should be pure - it should not modify the input parameters in any way.
